How It Works
Scraping Reviews
The tool uses Selenium for dynamic websites with pagination support to extract reviews across multiple pages.

Sentiment Analysis
It leverages a pre-trained DistilBERT model (distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english) for sentiment classification into positive, negative, or neutral categories.

Categorization & Visualization
Reviews are categorized into predefined topics (e.g., hiking, fees) based on keywords and visualized using bar charts and word clouds.

Example Output
